Rigor

Introduction
------------
Rigor is a framework for testing algorithms in a systematic fashion.  Users can import annotated images into the database, then run an algorithm against each of them in turn, finally producing a report that can be used for evaluating the algorithm.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Python v2.7 or higher
- The Python Imaging Library (PIL)
- psycopg2
- image repository on Ea mounted locally
- Sibyl library and Python extension modules built

Configuration
-------------

Copy the `rigor.ini.sample` file to `.rigor.ini` in your home directory.

- The `image_repository` is the local path where you have mounted the image repository on Ea
- The `python_root` points to the built Python extension modules inside Sibyl.

You may also need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to your Sibyl and OpenCV libraries.  For example, if you keep everything in `~/dev` on a 64-bit Linux machine:

	echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/dev/sibyl/build/modules/core:~/dev/sibyl/build/modules/money:~/dev/libs/opencv/current/linux-x86_64/lib' >> ~/.bashrc

Use
---
To run an algorithm against all images in its domain, use the `run.py` command.  For example, to run against the MoneyDetector in Sibyl:

	python run.py money ~/dev/sibyl/modules/money/data/config.xml

You can also limit the number of images, to do a quick test.  The following will only run 100 images:

	python run.py -l 100 money ~/dev/sibyl/modules/money/data/config.xml

If you want more advanced features, have a look in the `examples` folder.
